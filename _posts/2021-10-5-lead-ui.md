excerpt: Haveno is looking for a lead UI developer proficient in ReactJS and Typescript
---

Now that the design of Haveno is almost completed, we are looking for an experienced UI developer willing to work in exchange for XMR and able to lead the development of Haveno's user interface.

The skill set we are looking for:

- experience building well-designed ReactJS apps with Typescript
- experience as lead dev of a UI app
- familiar with open source and collaborative development
- experience leading a small group of UI developers (2-3 people)

The React app should use modern technologies and patterns which are supported and easily maintained by community members into the future, accounting for accessibility. The app will communicate to the Haveno daemon through gRPC APIs. Proof of concept: [github.com/haveno-dex/haveno-ui-poc](https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno-ui-poc).

If you are interested and have the skills we are looking for, send your portfolio to contact@haveno.exchange. If you want to chat with us join #haveno-dev (Matrix and IRC/Libera).
