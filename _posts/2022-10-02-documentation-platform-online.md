title: "The new documentation platform is online"
excerpt: Haveno now has a dedicated platform where to host documentation
author: Haveno Core Team

We now have a single place where we collect all the documentation related to Haveno: [docs.haveno.exchange](https://docs.haveno.exchange). The platform is meant to host technical and not technical information about Haveno and the structure of the network.

Now that the Haveno ecosystem is expanding, we want to give the community of users and developers a stable reference. In the docs you'll find technical information, like the trade protocol and the Haveno APIs, but also an explanation of all the entities that compose the Haveno ecosystem and of the bounty system, to mention some.

As always, suggestions from the community and feedback are appreciated.
