Hello all, this is information on registering to vote for Haveno Council's 3rd (possibly 4th and 5th seats) seats.

Current requirements to register to vote are a working email and a known online screen name from one of the given services in the form.

The polls will take place using the CIVS ([https://civs1.civs.us/](https://civs1.civs.us/)) voting software, and will take place in two parts.

There will be a Primary election with a write-in, then the top 5 ranked candidates will be nominated to the General election, where the winners will be chosen from the top 3.

Emails will be sent out from the CIVS platform once the polls have started.

(Times listed in EST)

Voter registration is open now, and will be closed on 02/20 (Tuesday) at 3PM.

Primary election will start on 02/20 at 3PM, and end on 02/21 at 3PM.

General election will start on 02/21 at 3PM and end on 02/22 at 3PM.


### Instructions below:

Register to vote using this form: [https://vote.haveno.exchange/form/GVkRjB](https://vote.haveno.exchange/form/GVkRjB)
Activate your email on CIVS. This will save you an email from us.

Confirm you can receive emails from CIVS (civs@cornell.edu) and Haveno (info@haveno.exchange) to make sure that they aren’t going to spam.

You will be emailed a link to vote for each poll. The email will start with “Poll:”. Make sure to verify the supervisor is info@haveno.exchange! It’s unlikely, but you may receive fake emails from someone else asking for you to vote!

Vote by ranking the choices (1 is best).

Save your receipt if you want the option to edit your vote!

### Important notes:

Aggregate voting results will be made public.

Do NOT share your voting link with anyone else.

If you have not yet received a voting email more than 24 hours after the intended launch time, please email info@haveno.exchange for assistance.

If you did not register your email with CIVS before the poll started, you will see a link to the poll after registering.
