We are happy to announce that our [Monero CCS proposal](https://ccs.getmonero.org/proposals/haveno-frontend.html) for funding the development of Haveno's user interface (the [design is on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/ijVTy2RIF8j36LF5y2sRtt/Haveno-Product-Design?node-id=856%3A5172)) has been accepted and it's now open for donations!

Thanks to all the people who commented and supported our proposal!

This is a fundamental step for Haveno. We need frontend experts to take care of building the user interface and we can't wait for them to start! We are crowdfunding **755 XMR** and we need your support!
