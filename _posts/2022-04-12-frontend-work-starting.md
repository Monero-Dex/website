Hello everyone! We are very happy to announce that our [Monero CCS proposal](https://ccs.getmonero.org/proposals/haveno-frontend.html) for raising the money to build the user interface of Haveno is completely funded. **We couldn't be more thankful** to the community for the overwhelming support and for the **179 donations** that made possible to rise the amount of 755 XMR **in only 4 days**!

As soon as the CCS got funded we got things in motion. We already had a meeting with the UI team to kickstart things and we had another meeting between designer, UI team and HCT yesterday. We also already created the **repository that will host the user interface**: [github.com/haveno-dex/haveno-ui](https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno-ui).

We received the first milestone of our CCS (151 XMR). The way we use these funds will be tracked on a dedicated file on the *haveno-meta* repository: [monero-ccs.md](https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno-meta/blob/master/monero-ccs.md). We suggest to 'watch' the repository, as it will make easier to keep track of changes to the file.

**Stay updated and contribute** to the development of the user interface! The team will be available for interacting with the community on our development room on matrix: [#haveno-dev:haveno.network](https://matrix.to/#/#haveno-dev:haveno.network) (*#haveno-dev* on IRC/Libera).
