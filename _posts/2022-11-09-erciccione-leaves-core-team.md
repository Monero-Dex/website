With heavy heart I'm announcing that the divergences between me and Woodser about our collaboration and the way we see the project became too big for me to be able to continue to work on Haveno. I'm leaving the Haveno core team effective immediately. I will be replaced by Vik of Cake Wallet, who will also take over my responsibilities in the project right after this post will be published, including managing the social media accounts and Haveno infrastructure.

I will be forever grateful to the community for the continuous support and wish Woodser and Vik good luck.
