We are excited to announce that Haveno is now mature enough to be used on Monero's main network.

This is the result of over 4 years of intensive development and collaboration across numerous developers.

### So how can I run Haveno on mainnet?

Haveno can be used on Monero's main network by using a third party installer and network. We do not officially endorse any networks at this time.

Alternatively, you can [start your own network](https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno/blob/master/docs/create-mainnet.md), or make test trades using our [official test network](https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno/blob/master/docs/installing.md).

Note that Haveno continues to be actively developed. If you find issues or bugs, please let us know.

See the official [GitHub repository](https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno) for more details.
